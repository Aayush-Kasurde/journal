# Journal - Get work done
Journal is documentation repository to store and retrieve command line help at single point.

We often come across time when we forget usage of particular command or procedure to perform
certain things. Journal tries to solve this problem by providing help of commands across 
softwares and operating systems.

Feel free to fork this repo.
